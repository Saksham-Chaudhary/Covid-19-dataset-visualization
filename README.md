# Covid-19-dataset-visualization
The first step of making the project started with finding a suitable dataset on I could work on. The dataset which I found a dynamic and live dataset which gets updated daily as the new cases are confirmed. Then I have imported my data and then after reading the data i have tested my data against SVM predictions and Polynomial regression predictions. After testing I have plotted the graphs showing confirmed cases, death cases and recovered cases of coronavirus in the world. Similarly I have plotted the same three graphs for some countries showing data of each country. Then a list is showing the confirmed cases, death cases ,recovery cases and active cases of all countries in tabular form. Then a pie chart displays the no of confirmed cases in some particular countries
